[OK, let's go!](./articles/README.md) [🎵](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL65X12ViYQ)

## Versions

|   Vue   | Angular |  React   |
| :-----: | :-----: | :------: |
| v2.6.11 | v9.0.0  | v16.13.0 |

> Sorry, but I use the newest versions for my notes when I created the repo. If in the future the new versions come, I'll update new changes. <del>Well, not guaranteed...</del>

## Why

Vue, Angular, and React are the three popular front-end frameworks nowadays. I am always wondering which one is the best for me, but I have no idea if I don't know them deeply. There are many articles and debates over the Internet, but obviously the authors have their own beliefs.

> <del>Every time I trust someone. They show me why I should trust no one.</del>

Therefore, why don't I just learn them all and find my own conclusions?

## How

In each article, I will only pick one small topic, then make compare and contrast to each framework. It should be short and easy to understand because I have no patience to read and write long paragraphs. Plus, it should be written in a hilarious tone because life should be full of humor. Finally, I will give scores for them to evaluate who does well. Hopefully, the one that gets the highest score is my ideal framework.

## <del>Actually Why</del>

<del>If I'm able to use all of them, I may have three times the opportunity of getting a nice job.</del>
